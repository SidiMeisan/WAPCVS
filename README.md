# WAPCVS

This record system is made for administrators in private healthcare centres to record the administered that has already been admitted. The system that we will create will be using a database system and website design. The system will be managed by an administrator to do basic operations such as creating new data, reading the data, updating the data, and deleting data. As a result of this project, patients will be able to freely make an appointment and choose the vaccinate that will be admitted to them.
